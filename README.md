# SCUT_SimpleDocument
This is an unofficial $\LaTeX$ template, adapted from Professor Zeng's CUMCM template and the South China University of Technology's undergraduate course project template (Microsoft Word version). It can be used for writing experiment reports, completing course projects, etc. The template was created due to the challenges of using Word documents, where formulas and matrices often appear poorly formatted, and automatic indentation can be troublesome and annoying.

Attention! This is a little bit different from the official one. Ask your teacher before you use it!
